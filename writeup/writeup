## Task 1
1. Lasso was used to select variables. From the plot, we noticed that the misclassification error is close to 0, which means the accuracy is pretty high.

\end{figure}

2. The baseline algorithms used for binary classifier are random forests, XGBoost, SVM and Neural Network. The table shows that SVM and Neural Network perform the best with accuracy 1 while other algorithms also have accuracy close to 1.

3. The final algorithm used for binary classifier is SVM with radial kernel.

## Task 2
1. Lasso and PCA are used to select variables. 


2. The baseline algorithms used for multiclass classifier are random forests, XGBoost, SVM and Neural Network. The table shows that SVM performs the best with accuracy 0.9289813.
