## Data files 

Two tab-delimited text files ``data/training_data.txt`` and ``data/test_data.txt`` are provided. The training data (labeled activity information included) should be used to construct and test your ML algorithms. Apply your algorithm to the test data (containing only feature information) and predict the activity corresponding to each time window.




## Learning tasks

1. Build a binary classifier to classify the activity of each time window into static (0) and dynamic (1). For this task, consider postural transitions as static (0). 
2. Build a refined multi-class classifier to classify walking (1), walking_upstairs (2), walking_downstairs (3), sitting (4), standing (5), lying (6), and static postural transition (7)

## Getting started

Two rmd files ``Rmd files/Task1.Rmd`` and ``Rmd files/Task2.Rmd`` are provided including all attempts.



## Result files

Two result text files ``results/binary_9982.txt`` and ``results/multiclass_9982.txt`` are provided. The two files show the best prediction for the test data.

The pdf file ``writeup.pdf`` is prvided which contains the process of the classifications and discussion about the final results.
